<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Youtube Video Processor

The project was built as a way to understand how Flask works and how as a backend developer you can show case your work by building a simple GUI using flask 

The aim of the project is to provide the user an easy interface to download youtube videos and specify if they want to convert the video to just audio, create images out of the video
or get the transcription.
